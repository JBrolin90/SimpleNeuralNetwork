# Copilot Instructions for Test Generation

When generating tests:
- Prioritize xUnit for both unit tests and integration tests.
- Use Mockito for mocking dependencies in unit tests.
- Ensure tests cover typical use cases, edge cases, and error handling.
- Assume that the test subjects are correctly implemented and focus on verifying behavior.
- Place unit tests in `SimpleNeuralNetwork.Tests`.
- Place integration tests in `SimpleNeuralNetwork.Tests`.
- Use descriptive test method names.
